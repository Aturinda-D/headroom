# Headroom

> Your Financial Breathing Space

A mobile-first budgeting app that helps you spend confidently and live debt-free by showing exactly how much money you have available for guilt-free spending.

## What is Headroom?

Headroom is a personal budget assistant built around three core concepts:

1. **Projects** - Separate financial contexts (Personal, Business, Family Pool) that keep your finances organized
2. **Wallets** - Track actual money stores (Cash, Mobile Money, Bank Account) with real-time balances
3. **Categories** - Your primary navigation and spending organization (Food, Transport, Bills, etc.)

At the heart of it all is your **"Free to Spend"** amount—a single number showing exactly what you can spend guilt-free after accounting for all your commitments.

The app works offline-first, so you can log expenses anywhere, anytime. Everything syncs seamlessly across your devices when you're back online.

## Key Features

- **Projects & Wallets** - Organize finances into separate contexts (Personal, Business, Family) with real money stores (Cash, Mobile Money, Bank)
- **Category-First Navigation** - Browse spending by category, each with its own budget and transaction history
- **Free to Spend Dashboard** - See your available spending money instantly (daily, weekly, or monthly tracking with automatic rollover)
- **Smart Recurring Transactions** - Set up bills and income once, let them auto-generate with optional confirmations
- **Offline-First** - Log transactions without internet, sync automatically later
- **Budget Goals & Alerts** - Set project-level and category-specific limits with intelligent notifications
- **Debt Tracking** - Monitor loan repayments and visualize your path to being debt-free
- **Cross-Device Sync** - Access your budget from phone, tablet, or web

## Why I'm Building This

This is my first full-stack project, born from wanting to solve a real problem: most budgeting apps feel tedious and restrictive. I wanted something that makes budgeting feel empowering instead of stressful.

I'm building Headroom to learn modern web development while creating something genuinely useful—a tool that helps people feel confident about their money without the anxiety that comes with traditional budgeting.
